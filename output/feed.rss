			<title>Ace Combat 7 - Mission 06 Flight Log</title>
			<link>http://finch204.com/posts/ace-combat-7-mission-06-flight-log</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I flew the &lt;a href="https://acecombat.fandom.com/wiki/F-14D_Super_Tomcat"&gt;F-14D Super Tomcat&lt;/a&gt; for this mission and could not beat it even after 5-6 tries. The problem lies with the fact that the F-14 equipped with the GPB (Guided Penetration Bomb) special weapon, simply cannot do enough damage in the amount of time provided for the mission. In normal mode, you have to score at least 17,000 points for you to accomplish your mission. I think the closest I got with the F-14 was 13,000 points.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<content:encoded>&lt;h3 id="flying-the-f-14d-super-tomcat"&gt;Flying the F-14D Super Tomcat&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I flew the &lt;a href="https://acecombat.fandom.com/wiki/F-14D_Super_Tomcat"&gt;F-14D Super Tomcat&lt;/a&gt; for this mission and could not beat it even after 5-6 tries. The problem lies with the fact that the F-14 equipped with the GPB (Guided Penetration Bomb) special weapon, simply cannot do enough damage in the amount of time provided for the mission. In normal mode, you have to score at least 17,000 points for you to accomplish your mission. I think the closest I got with the F-14 was 13,000 points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="flying-the-a-10c-thunderbolt-ii"&gt;Flying the A-10C Thunderbolt II&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was only able to beat this mission after I switched to the &lt;a href="https://acecombat.fandom.com/wiki/A-10C_Thunderbolt_II"&gt;A-10C Thunderbolt II&lt;/a&gt;. Even with just the default special weapon for the A-10C, which is the UGB (Unguided Bomb), I was able to beat Mission 06 on my 2nd try. The A-10C's ability to fly slowly over ground targets, coupled with the unguided bomb's wide explosion radius made it really easy to consistently hit multiple ground targets. I usually aimed to take out 3 targets with one bomb drop. It also helps that the A-10C is pretty sturdy, allowing it to take more hits from AA guns while you're trying to line up the perfect bomb drop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="warning"&gt;
!!! There might be some possible spoilers below. Consider yourself warned... !!!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="tips"&gt;Tips&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you select a target, you can see how much points you will gain if you destroy that target, by looking at the upper left corner of the screen. Use this info to help you prioritize targets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the start of the mission, the first enemy base you will encounter will have a couple of F-16s defending it. Shoot them down asap. If I remember correctly, in normal mode, each downed F-16 gives you 400 points. Also on that same base, there are bombers that will be taking off as soon as you start bombing the base. Shoot down all of those bombers to get a huge boost to your score. I don't remember exactly how much points you get for taking out each bomber; I think it was at least 1,000 points for each bomber though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focus on taking out SAM sites over any other ground target. This is specially important when you start attacking the 2nd and 3rd bases. Taking out SAM sites stops the enemy from shooting missiles at you, which means you don't waste time trying to dodge missiles. You can use that time instead to continue taking out ground targets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't try fighting the UAVs at the tail end of the mission. They are a distraction and will only slow you down. Focus on getting enough points to beat the mission. &lt;em&gt;You'll have a hard time shooting them down anyway, especially if you're flying an &amp;quot;Attacker&amp;quot; aircraft like the A-10C.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was hesitant to spend the money to purchase the A-10C Thunderbolt II for this mission because I was trying to save up for the F/A-18 Hornet. However it turns out useful for the next couple of missions. One mission in particular (I believe it was Mission 08) is similar to this one, where you need to score enough points by taking out ground targets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main takeaway from this post is that you should be flying an &amp;quot;Attacker&amp;quot; aircraft for Mission 06. At least that was the case for me, till next time folks, happy flying!&lt;/p&gt;

			<description>&lt;p&gt;I probably could have waited until tomorrow to officially create this blog, but I had some free time so why not make use of it,
right? Actually I was debating with myself as to whether I should just play another game of Lord of the Rings LCG, or work on
this blog. I chose the latter. Hello there stranger, welcome to my new gaming blog! On this site I plan to share notes, tips,
ideas, solutions that I've compiled from playing various tabletop games and video games.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I probably could have waited until tomorrow to officially create this blog, but I had some free time so why not make use of it,
right? Actually I was debating with myself as to whether I should just play another game of Lord of the Rings LCG, or work on
this blog. I chose the latter. Hello there stranger, welcome to my new gaming blog! On this site I plan to share notes, tips,
ideas, solutions that I've compiled from playing various tabletop games and video games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start off, I'm coming to you all the way down from the depths of Moria, where I tried to help a band of Dwarves escape and
failed miserably. If there's one thing you can say about the Lord of the Rings LCG card game, it's that it is not an easy game.
So let's get to some lessons I have learned while playing the Flight from Moria quest, for the 7th time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="bypassing-quest-stages"&gt;Bypassing Quest Stages&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/the-nameless-fear.jpg" class="img-float-left" alt="The Nameless Fear" title="The Nameless Fear"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the unique mechanics on the Flight from Moria scenario is having a quest deck. A quest deck consists of multiple Stage
2 quest cards. There are no Stage 3 quest cards in this scenario. To win the game, you have to find the correct Stage 2 quest
card that will allow you to escape the mines and therefore win the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another unique mechanic is the ability to bypass quest stages. Why then would you want to bypass quest stages? That is because
most of the Stage 2 quest cards award you a Victory point when you complete them. And these victory points only serve to
strengthen &lt;a href="http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/The-Nameless-Fear-KD"&gt;The Nameless Fear&lt;/a&gt; enemy which sits on the staging area
throughout the course of the game. The more Stage 2 quest cards you complete, the stronger the Threat/Attack values become for
The Nameless Fear. At the very least, you should not let the total amount of Victory Points get to 5, because if it does and
&lt;a href="http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/A-Foe-Beyond-KD"&gt;A Foe Beyond&lt;/a&gt; is revealed, one hero will take 5 damage. Assigning 5
points of damage to a hero usually means they end up dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sudden-pitfall"&gt;Sudden Pitfall&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/sudden-pitfall.jpg" class="img-float-right" alt="Sudden Pitfall" title="Sudden Pitfall"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beware the &lt;a href="http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Sudden-Pitfall-KD"&gt;Sudden Pitfall Treachery card&lt;/a&gt;. This card will ruin your
game if you're not careful. I mean decreasing the damage this treachery card does seems pretty straightforward; just always
quest with more than 1 character, the other character being one you are okay with discarding. So you want to be questing with
at least 1 expendable ally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes though you don't have any allies in place and you are forced to quest using only your heroes. These are the times
when this card will really hit you hard. I have lost Bifur to this card at least twice already; both happened during the start
of games. One was when I didn't have an ally in play yet at Round 1 and quested with both Bifur and Gimli. This treachery card
came up and poof! The other was when I had Erebor Record Keeper in play, but still decided to quest with Bifur and Gimli
instead, so that Gimli could be readied later by Erebor Record Keeper. That ended badly as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="need-a-way-to-know-the-top-card-on-the-encounter-deck"&gt;Need a way to know the Top Card on the Encounter Deck&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, without spoiling a very important Stage 2 quest card in the Flight From Moria scenario, I will just say that having a way to know what the top card on the encounter deck is, is going to make your life easier with this scenario. You can still probably win without that ability, but this scenario is hard enough as it is to play solo, having a card that can &amp;quot;scry&amp;quot; will certainly help. So a card like &lt;a href="http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Rumour-from-the-Earth-RtM"&gt;Rumour from the Earth&lt;/a&gt; or
&lt;a href="http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Henamarth-Riversong-Core"&gt;Henamarth Riversong&lt;/a&gt; will help a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that's it for my first post. Hopefully other people would have learned something from this post. I'm taking a breather from playing this quest but will definitely give it a go again in the future. I will not move forward to another quest until I beat this one!&lt;/p&gt;
