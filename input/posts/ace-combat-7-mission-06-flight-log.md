### Flying the F-14D Super Tomcat

I flew the [F-14D Super Tomcat](https://acecombat.fandom.com/wiki/F-14D_Super_Tomcat) for this mission and could not beat it even after 5-6 tries. The problem lies with the fact that the F-14 equipped with the GPB (Guided Penetration Bomb) special weapon, simply cannot do enough damage in the amount of time provided for the mission. In normal mode, you have to score at least 17,000 points for you to accomplish your mission. I think the closest I got with the F-14 was 13,000 points. 

### Flying the A-10C Thunderbolt II

I was only able to beat this mission after I switched to the [A-10C Thunderbolt II](https://acecombat.fandom.com/wiki/A-10C_Thunderbolt_II). Even with just the default special weapon for the A-10C, which is the UGB (Unguided Bomb), I was able to beat Mission 06 on my 2nd try. The A-10C's ability to fly slowly over ground targets, coupled with the unguided bomb's wide explosion radius made it really easy to consistently hit multiple ground targets. I usually aimed to take out 3 targets with one bomb drop. It also helps that the A-10C is pretty sturdy, allowing it to take more hits from AA guns while you're trying to line up the perfect bomb drop.

### Tips
- When you select a target, you can see how much points you will gain if you destroy that target, by looking at the upper left corner of the screen. Use this info to help you prioritize targets.
- At the start of the mission, the first enemy base you will encounter will have a couple of F-16s defending it. Shoot them down asap. If I remember correctly, in normal mode, each downed F-16 gives you 400 points. Also on that same base, there are bombers that will be taking off as soon as you start bombing the base. Shoot down all of those bombers to get a huge boost to your score. I don't remember exactly how much points you get for taking out each bomber; I think it was at least 1,000 points for each bomber though. 
- Focus on taking out SAM sites over any other ground target. This is specially important when you start attacking the 2nd and 3rd bases. Taking out SAM sites stops the enemy from shooting missiles at you, which means you don't waste time trying to dodge missiles. You can use that time instead to continue taking out ground targets.
- Don't try fighting the UAVs at the tail end of the mission. They are a distraction and will only slow you down. Focus on getting enough points to beat the mission. *You'll have a hard time shooting them down anyway, especially if you're flying an "Attacker" aircraft like the A-10C.*
- I was hesitant to spend the money to purchase the A-10C Thunderbolt II for this mission because I was trying to save up for the F/A-18 Hornet. However it turns out useful for the next couple of missions. One mission in particular (I believe it was Mission 08) is similar to this one, where you need to score enough points by taking out ground targets.

The main takeaway from this post is that you should be flying an "Attacker" aircraft for Mission 06. At least that was the case for me, till next time folks, happy flying!
