### Mission 16 - Last Hope

Mission 16 is an escort mission with a slight twist. The one you are escorting is being driven in a vehicle and the enemies must be identified first before you can engage. Having to identify the enemies first is what makes this mission not fun for me, but it is what it is. To quickly identify an unknown unit, you'll want to keep them as close to the center of your HUD as you can.

Most of the important targets in this mission are ground targets, so it will help to fly a plane with dedicated air to ground special weapon. There are some air targets in this mission, but they are secondary targets in my opinion. Your priority is to keep whoever you are escorting on the ground, alive. This means clearing out enemies which are attacking and blocking the vehicle you are escorting. You'll want to check which direction the escort vehicle is driving, fly ahead and identify enemy units, then shoot down enemy units. Rinse and repeat.

On my first campaign playthrough, I flew the [Typhoon](https://acecombat.fandom.com/wiki/Typhoon) for this mission. I had it equipped with the 8AGM (8-Target Air-to-Ground Missiles) special weapon. On one hand it was great that it could target 8 targets simultaneously, however this also presented a problem if you have not identified all the targets in your field of view. You could end up unintentionally targetting unknown friendly units and you don't want to do that. For this reason, I recommend flying a plane that targets at most, 4 ground targets simultaneously.

Which is why on my second campaign playthrough, I flew the [F-22A Raptor](https://acecombat.fandom.com/wiki/F-22A_Raptor) equipped with the XSDB special weapon for this mission. The F-22 equipped with the XSDB special weapon, will target at most, 4 ground targets simultaneously. I also think that the stealth abilities of the F-22 allows it some cover while you try to idenitfy enemy units first.

Unfortunately this mission takes place at night and so the replays looked pretty bad, so I don't have any clips to share. Hope everyone has a good weekend!
