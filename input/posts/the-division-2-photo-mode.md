One of the nice features that was added to The Division 2 is Photo Mode. On the Xbox One, you can activate it by opening the menu, then holding the X button. I'm not much of a photographer in real life, so I don't know much of what settings to use and there are number of them available, but it was nice to play around with it. Just make sure that there are no enemies nearby when you do, because the game doesn't pause even when you're in photo mode. 

On the Xbox One, you basically use the built-in Xbox screenshot capability, instead of the game itself saving the screenshot for you. Note that you can also turn the game UI on or off by pressing the "select" button.

Here are some screenshots I took from the game. This is a fun game that thankfully can still be played solo, just like the first game.
