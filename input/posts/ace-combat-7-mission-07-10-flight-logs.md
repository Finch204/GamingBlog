### Mission 07

Mission 07 has you hunting down Radar sites, so I thought it was a good mission to fly the [A-10C Thunderbolt II](https://acecombat.fandom.com/wiki/A-10C_Thunderbolt_II) in. I flew the A-10C with the 4AGM (4 Target Air-to-Ground Missile) special weapon. It was perfect for hunting down the radar sites and I was able to beat this mission with the A-10C. 

The highlight of this mission was the environment it was set in. You fly this mission in a rocky mountainous area with tall pillars. The tall pillars make it challenging to fly through the valley and occasionally they would serve as a sort of cover for the Radar sites. So you can't just fire your weapon as soon as you get a lock. At certain times, I had to change the angle of approach before firing. To make it even more challenging, there is also a severe thunderstorm covering the area. One of the highlights of this mission was getting hit with lightning and trying not to crash while your HUD is all messed up. It was fun!

The second half of this mission has you doing air to air combat and depending on how comfortable you are with the A-10C, it might be challenging to do the dogfighting part. If you are having trouble with the dogfighting part in this mission, you should be able to fly a fighter aircraft, like the F-16C, F-14D or F/A-18F. Hunting down the radar sites will be more of a challenge with those aircrafts, especially the F-16C and F-14D, since you will have to get closer to take down the radar sites. You can fly the F/A-18F with the long range anti-surface missiles to take down the radar sites easily. Any one of those three aircraft though should make the dogfight at the end easier though. In fact, I plan to fly a fighter aircraft in this mission for my next playthrough in hard mode.

### Mission 08

Mission 08 is quite similar to Mission 06, wherein you have to take out ground targets and score enough points to beat the mission. Just like Mission 06, I tried flying the F-14D for this mission and could not score enough points to beat the mission. I ended up using the [A-10C Thunderbolt II](https://acecombat.fandom.com/wiki/A-10C_Thunderbolt_II) again for this mission and was able to beat it. It was on this mission that I started to realize how much I underestimated the A-10C. *In fact, someone on Instagram mentioned that they beat the game using the A-10C. That is amazing considering the A-10C only seems fit for air to ground attacks. It can do a lot more than that apparently.*

Unlike Mission 06, the second half of this mission has you chasing down tanker trucks while a sandstorm covers the whole area. This means that the tanker trucks will only show up on the radar in random intervals. They don't show up long enough for you to see them on radar and get a lock on with your weapons. Which is another reason why I think the A-10C was perfect for this mission. 

The A-10C can fly slow enough without stalling, that it allows you to spot the tanker trucks in close range without inadvertently flying ahead of them. With the A-10C, I was able to fly low enough and slow enough to use the unguided bombs to take out the tanker trucks. The trucks that didn't get hit by the bombs, I took out with  missiles. 

The best tip I can give for tracking the tanker trucks is to fly in the direction that they were last seen in radar. Fly your plane low and slow and if you see any roads, follow the roads. Most tanker trucks will be driving on roads anyway, though I have seen some go off-road. There were a couple of trucks I found off-roading in a valley somewhere. Most of the time with the A-10C, I could see the trucks on the roads before my radar would pick them up. Once I spot them, I would line them up for the perfect bomb drops and  take out the remaining trucks with missiles.

### Mission 09

Mission 09 has you hunting down radar sites again but with a twist. For this mission, you need to fly below the clouds to avoid getting taken out by cruise missiles. If I remember correctly, one hit from these missiles and the game is over. 

I flew the [F/A-18F Super Hornet](https://acecombat.fandom.com/wiki/F/A-18F_Super_Hornet) equipped with the LASM (Long Range Air-to-Ship Missile) special weapon. I think it was the perfect choice for this mission. The long range air to ship missiles allowed me to take out the radar sites from a safe distance. There was only one radar site, that forced me to go above cloud cover to be able to safely navigate to it and get my shot off. You will get shot at once you are above cloud cover. The best thing you can do is to plan when you go above cloud cover, then once you commit to it, fire up the afterburners, fly up and get below cloud cover as soon as you can. The cruise missiles homing in on your plane should miss once you go into the clouds and below cloud cover.

The second half of this mission has you in air to air combat against enemy F/A-18F Hornets. It is an all out dogfight from this point on. To make it even more challenging, the enemy also deploys their Helios missiles. These are burst missiles that take out any plane in the blast radius. They show up as big red circles on radar. This is another reason why I think the F/A-18F Super Hornet was a great choice for this mission. You had to have a plane that could take out ground targets, be fast enough to go up and below cloud cover, be good enough for air to air combat and be fast enough to avoid the Helios missiles while dogfighting. The F/A-18F Super Hornet can do all of that.

### Mission 10

Mission 10 is an escort mission where you had to shoot down SAM sites and fight off enemy fighters. Just like in Mission 09, I flew the [F/A-18F Super Hornet](https://acecombat.fandom.com/wiki/F/A-18F_Super_Hornet) equipped with the LASM (Long Range Air-to-Ship Missile) special weapon. The LASM made easy work of the SAM sites and the F/A-18F was good enough for air to air combat. That said, on my next playthrough of this mission, I'll probably fly a different plane. *(More on that further below)*

Your main focus on this mission is to take out the enemy SAM sites. I found that when I prioritize fighing off the enemy fighters, I would lose the mission due to Roper 1 being shot down by the SAM sites. So follow those missile trails, take out the enemy SAM sites, then hightail it back to Roper 1 to shoot down the enemy fighters.

The second half of this mission has you going one on one against a super agile enemy UAV. Even with the F/A-18F Super Hornet, I had a challenging time trying to shoot down this UAV. It was very, very agile and could do ridiculous high-G turns which meant a lot of my missiles missed the target. The first time I played this mission, I ran out of time trying to shoot down the UAV. 

On my subsequent tries, after realizing I simply could not win the turning battle, I decided to fly up and then dive bomb the enemy UAV. It worked for a few times. I was able to get some of my missiles to hit. However after awhile, the enemy UAV started following me up whenever I went vertical. It was creepy to say the least, like it was learning from what I was doing. Eventually I managed to shoot it down, but not before wasting too many missiles and running the timer down to less than 1 and a half minutes.

There's supposed to be a pattern that this enemy UAV follows, that you can exploit to shoot it down. I never did figure that out. The one pattern I recognized was where it would fly away from you, then turn around quickly and will try to shoot you down with its machine guns. Since you were going head to head with the enemy UAV, obviously you will also have the chance to shoot missiles and fire your machine guns. However I found that my missiles would often get shot down by the UAV's machine gun. So my missiles never get a hit in those situations, at the same time my plane would get damaged from getting hit by the enemy's machine guns. That was when I decided to go vertical and try to win that way.

That is why on my next playthrough of this mission, I will fly a plane that can equip the SASM (Short Range Aerial Suppression Missile) special weapon, a weapon available on fighters like the F-16C and F-15s. With these missiles you should still be able to damage the enemey UAV, even if they dodged the missiles.

If you have some tips for shooting down the enemy UAV in Mission 10, or tips for the other missions, do share them in the comments below or send me an email. I'll end this post with some videos from Mission 09 and 10 where I was flying the F/A-18F Super Hornet.
