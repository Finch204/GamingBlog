I bought the Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown Pre-order / Deluxe Edition for the Xbox One. After a day or two, I received the code to download Ace Combat 6: Fires of Liberation, but that's it. Weeks have gone by and I never received the other pre-order bonuses. I ended up finishing the game without even acquiring the pre-order bonuses. 

Below is an image from the Bandai EU website showing the pre-order bonuses: namely the Boeing F4-E Phantom II, alongside three additional aircraft skins.

So today I decided to figure out how to get those pre-order bonuses. It turns out, all you have to do is to find the Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown Deluxe Launch Edition in the Xbox Store and install that one. The way I found it, was through the Xbox Store link in the Ace Combat 7 game menu itself. 

Selecting Xbox Store from the game menu, will bring you to the Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown Season Pass product page. *(I installed that too, since I also bought the deluxe edition.)* While on that product page, you can scroll down to the **Works with** section and on there you should find a listing for **Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown Deluxe Launch Edition**. Navigate to it and select Install. In my case, it started downloading 500+ MB worth of data and finally my pre-order bonuses showed up in game. 

I could now fly the F-4E Phantom II plane in campaign mode. In addition, the F-104C plane, the one piloted by Scrap Queen now also shows up in the Aircraft Tree. You cannot fly it in campaign mode as it has no weapons, but you can fly it in Free flight mode. Lastly, I now have the 3 additional aircraft skins: the Yellow 13 skin for the SU-37, the Razgriz skin for the F-14D and the Pixy skin for the F-15C.

I hope this post helps other people unlock their Ace Combat 7 pre-order bonuses on the Xbox One.
